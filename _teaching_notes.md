**parser.py**

`_positional_args` was trickier to implement than it seemed at first. I started
by splitting into two cases. The first case is the easy case, where there are no
variadic arguments. Then it's a simple case of mapping the argument's schema
name with the passed name, matching them up by position. `_map_p_args` is the
function I created to do this.

The second case is when there is an a variadic argument. My approach is to group
the passed arguments into three groups:

1. All arguments before the variadic argument.
2. The variadic argument.
3. All arguments after the variadic argument.

We can do this by first splitting the schema's positional arguments into the 3
groups. Then we can count up the `n_args` in each group to break up the passed
positional arguments into the 3 groups. Then it becomes easy to match up the
schema argumentss with the passed arguments in each group.

I should note that it's only possible to take this approach because we've
already validated the arguments so that we know it has the right number of
arguments, and that only one variadic argument is being used.

Hope you enjoyed this project. There are still many improvements and features
that could be made. I encourage you fork the project and make your own changes.
